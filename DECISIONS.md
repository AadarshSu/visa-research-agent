# Decisions

Why the project is shaped the way it is, including what was tried and rejected. The reasoning is
recorded because it is the part that cannot be recovered from the code later — a deleted feature
leaves no trace, and a rule with an obvious-looking alternative invites someone to "simplify" it
back into a bug.

Newest first. Add an entry when a decision is made, not afterwards.

## 12. Complete certificate chains; never disable verification
**2026-08-15 · commit `4032824`**

Vietnam's official e-visa portal failed TLS verification. The temptation was to skip verification
for "known legitimate" sites.

Diagnosis first: the certificate is genuine, issued by GlobalSign to Cục Quản lý xuất nhập cảnh (the
Vietnam Immigration Department), organisation-validated. The server simply omits the intermediate
linking it to the root. Browsers fetch that automatically; Python does not.

**Decided:** bundle the missing intermediates in `config/tls_intermediates/`, each verified to chain
to a root already in the trust store, so **no new trust is granted** — a server misconfiguration is
worked around and nothing else.

**Rejected:** `verify=False`, per-host or otherwise. An attacker able to intercept the connection
could impersonate an immigration authority and dictate what documents a traveller brings. That is
the single worst outcome this product can produce, and it would have been invisible.

Tests assert that expired, self-signed, hostname-mismatched and unknown-CA certificates are still
rejected, so a future "simplification" cannot quietly loosen this.

## 11. Search may generate candidates; it may never widen trust
**2026-08-15 · commit `42eec19`**

`AGENTS.md` said *"never add open-ended web search"*. Discovery needs some way to find pages.

Two readings were considered: crawl only within already-approved domains, seeded from official
travel-advice services; or use a search engine. Search was chosen because it is how a person
actually finds these pages and it works for any country without a per-country seed.

**Decided:** search is permitted **only inside `discovery/`**, and only as a candidate generator.
Nothing it returns becomes evidence until it passes the domain-trust rules. `AGENTS.md` was amended
rather than quietly contradicted, stating the constraint that replaces the old rule.

The resulting safety story: for *pages*, spam is structurally unreachable because results are
filtered to approved domains before anything is fetched. For *domains*, the human approves. The
entire added risk is concentrated in one human-gated decision per country rather than diffused.

## 10. A destination's own government outranks other countries' pages about it
**2026-08-15 · commit `50236df`**

The first live Vietnam bootstrap ranked `usembassy.gov` **first** — the US embassy in Vietnam. It is
`.gov`, so "looks governmental" passed, but it describes the rules for American citizens.

**Decided:** check that a domain sits under the destination country's own top-level domain, held as
data in `countries.yaml`. Foreign government pages still appear for review, flagged and never first.
A country's own government needs only one corroborating query, since that is a much stronger prior;
this also rescued `mofa.gov.vn`, which had been discarded for appearing once.

Found only because a third country was tested. Singapore and Japan could never have surfaced it.

## 9. A page can fill several roles
**2026-08-15**

Discovery originally assigned one role per page, on the assumption that a page is one thing.
Singapore's own hand-written configuration disproves it: the per-nationality page is listed as both
the decision source and the document checklist.

Forcing exclusivity meant that page won the decision role and the checklist role then went to a
narrower, wrong page. `ResolvedSource.roles` is now a list.

---

## 8. Wrong audience is a veto, not a penalty
**2026-08-15**

After fixing the above, Japan regressed to the **diplomatic passport** exemption list. It names many
nationalities, so it collected a nationality bonus and outscored the correct page.

**Decided:** hard wrong-audience terms — `diplomatic`, `official passport`, `spouse` — reject a page
outright rather than reducing its score. Some exclusions must not be outweighable by any
accumulation of positive signals. Archived paths and other-country pages work the same way.

---

## 7. Discovery is an offline command, not part of a request
**2026-08-15**

Discovery contacts many pages and changes what the application would treat as official.

**Decided:** it runs as `visa-discover`, deliberately, with a person looking at the result.
Generating a plan still visits only configured URLs and never searches. Wiring discovery into
request time is deferred until its ranking is trusted, and would sit behind per-corridor caching.

## 6. Structured conflict detection: built, then deliberately deleted
**2026-08-14 · recorded in commit `c4c0287`**

A deterministic conflict detector was fully built and working. The model reported what each source
said about four questions in a canonical form; the application compared them and applied precedence.
It correctly found the real Singapore discrepancy — three pages requiring six months of passport
validity measured from entry, from departure, and from an unstated point.

**Deleted anyway.** Nothing recorded *who a claim applied to*, so a general page listing visa-free
nationalities and a nationality-specific page requiring a visa compared as though they contradicted
each other. A false "sources disagree on whether you need a visa" is the most damaging thing this
product could emit.

The generalised lesson, which governs later decisions: **a feature whose wrong answers are alarming
must have a near-zero false-positive rate, or it should not ship.** Errors a user sees must be
near-impossible; errors only the maintainer sees can be noisy.

If revisited: record the population each claim applies to and compare only same-scope claims; leave
the visa decision out entirely, since it has stronger guards already; restrict comparison to
quantitative rules where a wrong flag costs a caveat rather than alarm.

## 5. Refuse rather than serve evidence that may be wrong
**2026-08-14 · commit `1c9fec9`**

Originally any failure collapsed the whole run into an opaque 503.

**Decided:** each source resolves to a typed outcome; a plan is `verified` or `partial`; and a
missing *required* source refuses the run **before the model is called**, naming what was missing.
A plausible substitute for a document checklist is worse than no answer.

---

## 4. Cached evidence reports when it was really retrieved
**2026-08-13 · commit `672f0e9`**

When serving from cache, `retrieved_at` is the original fetch time, never now.

Stamping the current time would replace a *visible* staleness problem — a plan showing an old date —
with an invisible one. The same reasoning drives the stale ceiling: past it, a source is refused
rather than served, because "no answer" beats "confidently out-of-date answer".

---

## 3. Reviewable policy in git; secrets in `.env`
**2026-08-13 · commit `672f0e9`**

`.env` had collected three different kinds of setting: secrets, behavioural policy, and machine
tuning. Only the first belongs in an untracked file.

**Decided:** `source_mode`, `extraction_mode`, the cache TTL and the stale ceiling moved to a
committed `config/runtime.yaml`. They decide whether government sites are contacted, whether a paid
model runs, and when stale guidance is refused — all of which deserve code review and a diff.

A concrete cost had already been paid: inspecting which mode was active meant printing the file, and
the API key went with it.

---

## 2. Trust the domain, never the prose
**2026-08-13 · commit `1c9fec9`**

The founding rule. Officialness is decided by who controls the domain, checked at configuration
load, after every redirect, and after every forward. Page content is never a factor, because a
convincing page is exactly what an attacker or an SEO-optimised agency produces.

Consequence worth stating: an appointed provider such as VFS **cannot** pass domain trust, and is
authorised only by an official page naming it.

## 1. Separate retrieval from extraction behind a protocol
**2026-08-12 · commit `28a6e30`**

`SourceFetcher` and `VisaPlanExtractor` are protocols, so fixtures and live retrieval are
interchangeable and the offline path remains a deterministic regression baseline.

This paid off repeatedly: live retrieval, PDF support and discovery's shortlist fetching were all
added without touching the extractor. Discovery reuses `LiveSourceFetcher` wholesale rather than
reimplementing trust checks.
